# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 26 2021 (RollX)


**Today's Progress**: Built a spinner nicknamed RollX using CSS and Javascript,
i named it RollX because it rotates in an X direction.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS and Javascript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at them.
